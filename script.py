Tech Spec of Batch Inviter	

Input a list of emails (on a text document for example) - Check

Read those emails onto an array - Check

Invite people (rate limited) - check

When the invalid error message is returned stop - check

Ping every 5 seconds

If it allows, then keep sending rate limited emails - check

Have a dashboard of sorts that shows which ones are sent and which ones are havenâ€™t'''
